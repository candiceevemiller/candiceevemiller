- 👋 Hi, I’m Candice!
- 🪱 Please check out my worm-world project - it's my most ambitious yet!
- 👀 AI/ML is my main interest but I'm a big lover of all theoretical and applied computer science. I love to code in Python and JavaScript. and I'm working on getting better in C++ and Go for more performant software. I'm very good at scripting, getting better at designing modular fully-fledged applications I'm fluent in Python, HTML, and CSS, intermediate in JavaScript, and I could hack something together in C++ or Golang but it would definitely take longer.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on making Worm World more interesting, building out my personal website, and recreating Johannes Kepler's calculations of Mars' orbit.
- 💞️ I’m looking for work! My last company just folded and I'm out of work, but that's ok because I'm happy to take the next step forward. I'm most excited for AI/ML Engineering/Research roles, Data Scientist roles (especially in the sciences themselves), and I'm always down to help out with a video game.

*When coding, as in life, make sure you leave the campground cleaner than you found it.*
