- 👋 Hi, I’m Candice!
- 🪱 Please check out my worm-world project - it's interesting!
- 👀 AI/ML is my main interest but I'm a big lover of all theoretical and applied computer science. I;m language agnostic, they all do the same things in the end and they're all relatively similar. Some have benefits in some situations in terms of speed or how lightweight they are but I'm not usually working at the baremetal level where such particulars are necessary.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on learning French Foil and Scottish Broadsword.
- 💞️ I’m looking for work! My last company hit a rough patch and I'm out of work, but that's ok because I'm happy to take the next step forward. I'm excited to continue my web development journey or hop to a research team developing the novel AI/ML architectures. I'd also love a role that afforded me the opportunity to learn some more devops and cloud skills.
