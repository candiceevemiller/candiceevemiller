- 👋 Hi, I’m Candice!
- 🪱 Please check out my worm-world project - it's strange and interesting (and needs a refactor)!
- 👀 AI/ML is my main interest but I'm a big lover of all theoretical and applied computer science. I'm language agnostic, but currently I'm learning C and like the power of optimization and the ability to touch baremetal. I'm especially interested in picking up graphics programming, high performance computing skills, and CUDA while I'm exploring C.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on learning French Foil and Scottish Broadsword.
- 💞️ I’m looking for work! I'm happy to join teams where I have room to grow.
