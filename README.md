- 👋 Hi, I’m Candice!
- 👻 My github has been a little neglected over the last few months so if you don't see anything that impresses you - check back soon I'm excited about the projects I have time to work on in the short term.
- 👀 AI/ML is my main interest but I'm a big lover of all theoretical and applied computer science. I love to code in Python and JavaScript and I'm working on getting better in C++ and Go for more performant software. I'm very good at scripting, getting better at designing modular fully-fledged applications
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to build my own APIs, I'm adding another JavaScript framework to my repertoire, repolishing my knowledge of design patterns, and building out my personal website. I'm fluent in Python, HTML, and CSS, intermediate in JavaScript, and I could hack something together in C++ or Golang if you put a gun to my head.
- 💞️ I’m looking for work! My last company just folded and I'm out of work, but that's ok because I'm happy to take the next step forward. I'm most excited for AI/ML engineering/research roles with cybersecurity roles as my next top pick. I'm interested in all kinds of computer science, developer, and researcher roles as well though so don't hesitate to reach out.
