- 👋 Hi, I’m Candice!
- 🪱 Please check out my worm-world project - it's strange and interesting (and needs a refactor)!
- 👀 AI/ML is my main interest but I'm a big lover of all theoretical and applied computer science. I'm language agnostic, they all do the same things in the end and they're all relatively similar, but that doesn't mean I don't know how to choose the right tool for the job.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on learning French Foil and Scottish Broadsword.
- 💞️ I’m looking for work! My last company hit a rough patch and I'm out of work, but that's ok because I'm happy to take the next step forward. I'm excited to continue my web development journey or hop to a research team developing the novel AI/ML architectures. I'd also love a role that afforded me the opportunity to learn some more devops and cloud skills.
