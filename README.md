- 👋 Hi, I’m Candice!
- 👀 I’m interested in AI and Machine Learning, robotics, game development, space travel, anything really!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning time series analysis, pen testing, and polishing my Javascript. I'm fluent in Python, HTML, and CSS. I could hack something together in C++ if you put a gun to my head.
- 💞️ I’m looking to make some contributions to open source projects
