- 👋 Hi, I’m Candice!
- 🪱 Please check out my worm-world project - it's strange and interesting (and needs a refactor)!
- 👀 AI/ML is my main interest but I'm a big lover of all theoretical and applied computer science. I'm language agnostic, but currently I'm learning C and like the power of optimization and the ability to touch baremetal. I'm especially interested in picking up graphics programming, high performance computing skills, and CUDA while I'm exploring C. Once I've truly mastered C I'm looking to pick up some modern alternatives as well including Rust and Zig. I'm also learning to use neovim on a more permanent basis.
- 🧠 I'm knowledgeable in Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, R, Julia, Matlab. I know a bit of Go and C# but I'm studying low level, high performance C the most right now. I'm good with deploying architecture, configuring Nginx, cloud services, React, mathematical computing, etc. I've worked as Full Stack and as a Data Scientist professionally.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on learning French Foil and Scottish Broadsword.
- 💞️ I’m looking for work! I'm happy to join teams where I have room to grow.
